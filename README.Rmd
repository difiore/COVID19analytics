# COVID19analytics

 <!-- . -->

This package curate (downloads, clean, consolidate, smooth) [data from Johns Hokpins](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/) for analysing international outbreak of COVID-19. 
 
It includes several visualizations of the COVID-19 international outbreak.

The package was inspired by [this blogpost](https://www.r-bloggers.com/coronavirus-data-analysis-with-r-tidyverse-and-ggplot2/) from [Yanchang Zhao](https://www.r-bloggers.com/author/yanchang-zhao/)


Yanchang Zhao, COVID-19 Data Analysis with Tidyverse and Ggplot2 - China. RDataMining.com, 2020.

URL: http://www.rdatamining.com/docs/Coronavirus-data-analysis-china.pdf.

* COVID19DataProcessor generates curated series
* The original process and visualizations are included in ReportGenerator R6 object 
* More process and visualization included int ReportGeneratorEnhanced R6 object

# Consideration
Data is still noisy because there are missing data from some regions in some days. We are working on in it.

# How to get started (Development version)

Install the R package using the following commands on the R console:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rOpenStats/COVID19analytics", build_opts = NULL)
```

# How to use it

```{r load}
library(COVID19analytics) # Optional but strongly recommended
```

```{r}
data.processor <- COVID19DataProcessor$new(force.download = FALSE)
dummy <- data.processor$curate()

rg <- ReportGeneratorEnhanced$new(data.processor)
rc <- ReportGeneratorDataComparison$new(data.processor = data.processor)

top.countries <- data.processor$top.countries
international.countries <- unique(c(data.processor$top.countries,
                                    "Japan", "Singapore", "Korea, South"))
latam.countries <- sort(c("Mexico",
                     data.processor$countries$getCountries(division = "sub.continent", name = "Caribbean"),
                     data.processor$countries$getCountries(division = "sub.continent", name = "Central America"),
                     data.processor$countries$getCountries(division = "sub.continent", name = "South America")))

```

```{r}

```


```{r}
